## An extension of nunustudio.org so all the documumentation should be the same

- phantasmStudio is an open source 3D VR game engine for the web it allows designers and web developers to easily develop 3D experiences that can run directly in a web page or be exported as Desktop applications.

- It has a fully featured visual editor, supports a wide range of file formats, the tools are open source and completely free to use for both personal and commercial usage, it is powered by open web APIs like WebGL, WebXR and Web Audio.

- Visual scene editor, code editor, visual tools to edit textures, materials, particle emitters and a powerful scripting API that allows the creation of complex applications.

- The project  build on top of open source libraries with good community support like [nwjs.io](https://nwjs.io), [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js), [cannon.js](https://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js), [opentype](https://opentype.js.org), [jscolor.com](http://jscolor.com), [codemirror.net](https://codemirror.net), [leapjs](https://github.com/leapmotion/leapjs), [jshint.com](https://jshint.com), [yuidoc](https://yui.github.io/yuidoc)

- Fully featured [web version](https://www.phantasmstudio.org/build/editor/index.html) of the editor is available on the project page.

- The web version is tested with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge), mobile browsers are supported as well.



### Getting Started

- [API Documentation]()  (coming soon) with full details about the inner working of every module are available.

 <!-- These can also be generated from the project source code by running `npm run docs`. -->

- Basic tutorials are available on the [project page]() (coming soon). The basic tutorials explain step-by-step how to use the editor.

### Screenshots
(coming soon)

### Features

- Visual application editor
  - Drag and drop files directly into the project (images, video, models, ...)
  - Manage project resources.
  - Edit material, textures, shaders, code, ...
- Built on [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library
  - Real time lighting and shadow map support
  - three.js libraries can be imported into the editor
  - Wide range of file formats supported (gltf, dae, obj, fbx, 3ds, ...)
- [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) exports for desktop and mobile deployment
- Physics powered by [cannon.js](https://schteppe.github.io/cannon.js/)
- Compatible with [WebXR](https://www.w3.org/TR/webxr/) for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality

### Building

- The project uses a custom solution for code bundling
  - The building system generates minified builds for the runtime and for the editor
  - JavaScript is optimized and minified using [Google closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/library)
  <!-- - Documentation generation uses [YuiDocs](https://yui.github.io/yuidoc/) -->
- To build the project first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM and ensure that java command is working properly.
- Install dependencies from npm by running `npm install`


<!-- - Build  editor, runtime and documentation, run `npm run build` -->

<!-- #### Embedding Application

- Application developed with can be embedded into already existing web pages, and are compatible with frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [React](https://reactjs.org/).
- To embed applications in HTML pages the following code can be used, the application is bootstrapped using the `loadApp(file, id)` method.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="phantasm.min.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body onload="PhantasmApp.loadApp('pong.nsp', 'canvas')">
        <canvas width="800" height="480" id="canvas"></canvas>
    </body>
</html>
```
